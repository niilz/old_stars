- Maybe move modal back into App again (might be cleaner) otherwise clean App
- Check water-ratio in backend as well
- add favicon
- Add cigarets
- Do not filter in user-view for admin-roles
- Insert main user with role: Admin
- just check role not role-name for admin-login (might already be the case)
- Get rid of LoginState (I think it is not needed anymore)
- make histories scrollable
- allow for exporting
- allow admin to yank all sessions
- get rid of all the diesel warnings
- Store session in DB or at least remove it at some point
- Check that niilz.de is available via 443 over https
